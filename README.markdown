This is a codebase that Tyler M and Jared built a long time ago; thinking it might be good for labs/old archive idk - it's a good web app example (it IS dated though). 
Issues: 
* needs to fix retina images.
* needs to load properly in the browser; if you drag in the index.html page into a browser it works, but clicking on it does not; want to talk w JD about it.
